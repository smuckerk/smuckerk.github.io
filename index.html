            <h2>My background...</h2>
            <p>
              Hello! I am Kennedy Smucker, a current student at the University of Michigan, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Biomolecular Science as part of the LSA Honors Program. I began my academic journey at Michigan State University Lyman Briggs College, and transferred to UM beginning in my sophomore year. I have always been dedicated to my studies and am working towards my goal of attending medical school. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I have several experiences with hands-on research, the most notable one being as a Research Assistant at Zoetis Pharmaceutical. Under the guidance of Principal Scientist, Dr. Mark Wolfe, I researched the effects of plant extracts on prostate cancer cells, performing complex laboratory techniques and presenting my findings at many large research showcases. I've also conducted studies on topics ranging from Alzheimer's disease to autoimmune disorders, which has built and strengthened my analytical skills. 
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to research, I've had the opportunity to share my love for science by working as a Teaching Assistant at the Kalamazoo Area Math and Science Center. During my time there, I developed and taught science curricula to K-8th students, focusing on fostering an interest in STEM, particularly within underprivileged communities. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As I continue my academic journey, I am actively seeking new research opportunities to build on my experiences and contribute to meaningful scientific discoveries. My passion for healthcare and research is my motivation for advancing in the field of medicine. 
            </p>
